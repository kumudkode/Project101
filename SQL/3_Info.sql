/* Databases are dynamic resources 
We can add, update, delete data from them

These operations are known as Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands
The main DML commands are:
    CREATE - to create new tables
	READ - to read data from tables
	UPDATE - to modify existing data
	DELETE - to remove data
